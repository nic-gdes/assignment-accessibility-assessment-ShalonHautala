          <p>
            By Evan Wild
          </p>

          <p>
            Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures,
             self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from 
             renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.
          </p>

          <p>
            So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? 
            In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
          </p>

        <h1>Types of bear</h1>

          <p>
            Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, 
            then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in 
            urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourange different behaviour however, as 
            you'll find out below. The below table also gives you some useful facts about bears.
          </p>

        <table>
          <caption>Types of Bear</caption> <!-- We add a <caption> to briefly describe the form's purpose -->
          <thead>
            <tr id="heading">
              <th scope="col">Bear Type</th>
              <th scope="col">Coat</th>
              <th scope="col">Adult size</th>

              <th scope="col">Diet</th>
              <!-- For the main header row, we don't need to use heading tags for semantics, what we need is actually to use the Table Head <th> element. We also want to add a scope to let screen readers know what information belongs to this heading. -->
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Wild</th> <!-- just like the headings above, these headings are meant to describe the data in the row it's in, so we need to make it a table heading, and add the scope="" attribute. -->
              <td>Brown or black</td>
              <td>1.4 to 2.8 meters</td>
              <td>Woods and forests</td>
              <td>25 to 28 years</td>
              <td>Fish, meat, plants</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Urban</th>
              <td>North Face</td>
              <td>18 to 22</td>
              <td>Condos and coffee shops</td>
              <td>20 to 32 years</td>
              <td>Starbucks, sushi</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h1>Habitats and Eating habits</h1>

          <p>
            Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other natually growing ingredients. In general 
            they will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their 
            sustenance from farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or 
            cottages.
          </p>

          <img src="media/wild-bear.jpg"> <!-- we should add alt="" attributes to images meant for content so they can be described by a screen reader for users who can't see. -->

          <p>
            Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other 
            urban creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge 
            from readily available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food has 
            proven scarce, urban bears have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials 
            like baked beans, ready meals, and microwave ovens.
          </p>

          <img src="media/urban-bear.jpg"> <!-- we should add alt="" attributes to images meant for content so they can be described by a screen reader for users who can't see. -->

          <p>
            Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to the toilets in McDonalds, to 
            their own apartment.
          </p>

        <h1>Mating rituals</h1>

          <p>
            Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest 
            of their lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for 
            example with cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a 
            Michael Bublé CD in the case of an urban bear.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following audio clip contains a fact file providing more details about bear mating rituals, along 
            with samples and quotes from experts.
          </p>

        <!--
          For multimedia, you want to include a place for users to download the file if the browser they are using can't play it (Include a download link in the <p> fallback after the <source> elements above).
          You also want to include a transcript. For audio it's enough to link to a transcript page, or write the transcript out in HTML if it's small enough not to mess up the page. For video, just make sure it has proper closed captioning.

                <p>Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their 
                  sniffing little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of 
                  putting them all in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.
